bathroom was enough and very clean
	__label__卫生干净

and the lockers were provided now ( i was reading some reviews earlier that there was no locker )
	__label__NULL

it was in the best location in the heart of lisbon and very easy to find
	__label__位置优越

only one tiny thing that i don t like is that the bedroom had automatic light , it would turn on when someone move , so when people turn their head or move their arms , the light turns on , and it kept turn on and off for the whole night.

i stayed there twice this week , perfect location with easy access to rambla and other key areas , great for somewhere cheap to sleep if that 's all you need , towels provided , rooms are clean , beds are comfortable.
	__label__NULL

perfect for our needs
	__label__NULL

reasonable price , interconnecting rooms , buffet breakfast ( which the kids loved ) and best of all amazing beds ! great location for exploring london
	__label__餐饮满意

	__label__NULL

the hotel staff are very nice and give very good service

the breakfast takes place on the top floor with great view to borgaza gardens.

room small , could n't walk round one side of bed
	__label__房间设施一般

restaurant and bar closed at 5pm
	__label__NULL

we asked for menu just before five to dine later and told we could n't
	__label__NULL

nothing much else around so you either go more into centre or go hungry
	__label__NULL

breakfast was lovely and cheaper this month so was a bargain.
	__label__餐饮满意

believe it or not is not quite a hostel , nor an apartment , but somehow both at the same time
	__label__NULL

in short , it has been the most comfortable shared apartment i have ever stayed in because it actually is and feels like a luxury apartment in a great neighborhood in vienna
	__label__NULL

instead of a common room you get an amazing living room and instead of a dorm room you get a comfortable shared bedroom
	__label__NULL

more than that , lilly , who runs the place alone , provides you with everything , from breakfast in the morning to free laundry ( wash , dry , and fold )
	__label__服务周到

she is there only in the mornings , but she absolutely takes care of everything
	__label__NULL

she is on intercom 24 7 , and upon your late check in you 'll be greeted with a handwritten welcome note , a map , a towel , and everything you 'll need
	__label__NULL

the apartment is an all inclusive apartment so all you need is some free time to explore vienna
	__label__NULL

thank you lilly for your wonderful hospitality , and for your amazing morning coffees !
	__label__NULL

dear bubbles150 , thank you for your kind review of our premier inn , its great to hear how much you enjoyed your stray with us
	__label__NULL

i am so pleased to hear you found our staff to be so warm and friendly
	__label__NULL

we hope to see you again soon ! kind regards , margaret auldoperations manager
	__label__NULL

i have to say that only advantage was price
	__label__NULL

we got this for 40 on booking.comhotel looks very ugly
	__label__NULL

room was not nice , windows were very weak
	__label__房间设施一般

we missed chair for table.hotel was shaking every few minutes
	__label__NULL

i think that this is due close paddington train station and heathrow express
	__label__NULL

street was very noise and we could hear everything from another rooms
	__label__房间设施一般

elevator was very slow
	__label__NULL

i think slowest in world ) i think that next time i will chose different hotel
	__label__NULL

i would recommend to visit this hotel only if you get good rate and you couldn t find anything else.
	__label__NULL

we stayed in this hotel with our sons on a quick visit to tallinn and helsinki
	__label__NULL

the location was ideal for us , 5 mins walk from the main shopping and tourist areas but in a quiet area for a relaxing sleep at night
	__label__位置优越

the rooms were small but more than adequate
	__label__NULL

despite our differing heights and weights we all found the beds extremely comfortable
	__label__NULL

after a less than positive experience in tallinn the large buffet breakfast was a welcome surprise and exceptionally good value in a city where we found dining of any sort was extremely expensive
	__label__NULL

the staff were always helpful the barman even found and gave us a leaflet on the history of the building in response to a casual remark about the large pillars evident throughout the hotel.
	__label__服务周到

thank you for your review and feedback , it is fantastic you had a good stay , i am really pleased to read your daughter and her friends thought the apartments were amazing and i am glad it added to the experience of them going to the concert ( i hope they also enjoyed seeing justin bieber ) regarding your comment on the recycling , i just wanted to let you know this is all done by brindleyplace ( behind the scenes ) so recycling does happen it just is n't very obvious
	__label__NULL

we look forward to welcoming you back to saco in the near future.
	__label__NULL

i had an outside room , next to the main ring road and at night the emergency service vehicles seemed to wake me up every few minutes
	__label__NULL

apart from that , the hotel offered good value and good service
	__label__NULL

the rooms are small and the bathroom very cramped , but after all , you get what you pay for and i thought the business rate including wifi and breakfast was great value for money
	__label__NULL

staff were very friendly and helpful , despite having a crowd of people arriving who seemed to want to find fault with everything
	__label__服务周到

it 's an ibis you know what it is going to be like and it delivers exactly as expected
	__label__NULL

the location is great , just a few minutes' walk from the main station
	__label__交通便利

i used a bus to get out to rwth ikv
	__label__交通便利

the bus stopped very close to the hotel , an it was easy to walk into the old town , cathedral and marketplace
	__label__交通便利

so all in all , a good couple of days in aachen.
	__label__NULL

dear supi 12thank you for your review on tripadvisor
	__label__NULL

i take every feedback from my guests very seriously and i am therefore shocked to hear how unpleased you were
	__label__NULL

i would like to take this opportunity to comment on your remarks.it 's correct that we have no air conditioning
	__label__NULL

i am sorry that you were not able to sleep with open windows
	__label__NULL

as we are situated on the main street , there will always be some kind of noise.all of our bathtubes work just perfectly and i can not imagine that someone from my team told you not to use it.i do remember that issue about the breakfast
	__label__NULL

let me put things the right way you did not come 10 minuts too late , it was almost 1 hour ! breakfast is available from 7 to 10 am , and at 11am the restaurant has to be prepared for our lunch business ( and this is the time you showed up ) .then you told me that you have a train to catch in short time , so i brought you 3 boxes with diffrent sandwiches , fruits , mineral water , some sweets and helped carrying your luggage to the train station.i am sorry that you did not leave us with a smile and i hope that you did enjoy the rest of your trip.kind regards , corsin biertgeneral manager

the room ( 202 ) was in front of one of the two elevators but we never heard a sound
	__label__NULL

the room has a spacious bathroom to your left as you enter
